the side of the tape closer to the tape roll (i.e. farther away from the camera) is marked at 1-inch intervals.
heights are marked from estimated camera screen (roughly 0.5 inches from edge of camera, i.e. reflective grayish edge, not black plastic region)

the far side of the second piece of tape (width is slightly more than the inch markers, but significantly less than the first piece)
is the 0 inch marker (supposed to be center of camera)
